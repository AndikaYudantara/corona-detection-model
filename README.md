STEPS TO BUILD DETECTION MODEL

1. X-ray images for patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 are collected 
2. “normal” (i.e., not infected) X-ray images from healthy patients are collected
3. Divide the dataset in test, train and validate dataset 
4. Train a CNN to automatically detect COVID-19 in X-ray images via the dataset we created
5. Evaluate the results
